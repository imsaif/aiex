## Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Modern routing with app directory structure
- **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Pattern-Centric Data Architecture
- Central pattern registry (`src/data/patterns.ts`) imports from individual pattern modules
- Each pattern follows structured format with content, examples, and code samples
- Zod schema validation ensures data integrity (`src/schemas/pattern.schema.ts`)
- Pattern loading utilities handle dynamic imports and validation

#### 2. Context-Based State Management
- `PatternProvider` (`src/contexts/PatternContext.tsx`) provides global pattern state
- Custom hooks (`usePatterns`, `usePattern`, `usePatternsByCategory`) for data access
- Optimized with memoization for performance
- Error boundaries and loading states handled centrally

#### 3. Component Architecture
- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable design system components
- **Section Components** (`src/components/sections/`): Page-specific sections
- **Example Components** (`src/components/examples/`): Interactive pattern demos
- **Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`): Navigation and structure

#### 4. Type-Safe Schema System
- Zod schemas define all data structures with validation
- TypeScript types exported from schemas for consistency
- Safe and throwing validation functions available
- Development helpers for detailed error reporting

### Directory Structure

#### Source Code (`src/`)
- `app/` - Next.js 15 app router pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components organized by type
- `contexts/` - React context providers and hooks
- `data/` - Pattern data, categories, and utilities
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (favorites, search, pagination)
- `schemas/` - Zod validation schemas
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

#### Pattern Data (`src/data/patterns/`)
- `patterns/` - Individual pattern implementations
- `categories/` - Pattern category definitions
- `examples/` - Example implementations
- `utils/` - Pattern-specific utilities

#### Testing (`src/components/**/__tests__/`)
- Component tests co-located with components
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- 100% coverage for critical components (Button, CodeBlock)

## Pattern Development Workflow

### Pattern Structure (All 14 Patterns Complete)
All AI design patterns have been implemented following the structured format:
1. Each pattern has its own directory in `src/data/patterns/patterns/[pattern-name]/`
2. Consistent structure with index.ts, code-examples.ts, considerations.ts, guidelines.ts
3. All patterns imported in `src/data/patterns.ts`
4. All patterns validated with `npm run test:patterns`
5. Interactive demos available for most patterns

### Pattern Structure Requirements
- `id` and `slug` must match and use kebab-case
- Minimum 1 example with image, description, and alt text
- Minimum 1 guideline and 1 consideration
- Code examples should include title, description, and working code
- All images must be optimized and use proper formats

## Testing Strategy

### Current Coverage
- **29 passing tests** with comprehensive test suite
- All 14 AI design patterns implemented and validated
- Components with tests: Button, CodeBlock, Carousel, Navbar, and many others
- Data validation with 100% coverage: Patterns, Categories
- Coverage thresholds set at 70% (currently building up from 0% baseline)

### Testing Tools
- **Jest** with Next.js integration
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Zod** for data validation testing
- **Playwright** configured for e2e testing (not yet implemented)

### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `src/components/**/__tests__/`
- Data tests: `src/data/__tests__/`
- Utility tests: `src/utils/__tests__/`

## Build & Performance

### Image Optimization
- Automatic WebP/AVIF generation
- GIF to WebM/MP4 conversion for animations
- Responsive image sizing with Next.js Image
- Aggressive caching (1 year TTL)

### Bundle Optimization
- Custom webpack configuration for chunk splitting
- Separate bundles for: framework, motion, syntax-highlighter, search
- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- Turbo mode in development

### Performance Monitoring
- Vercel Speed Insights integration
- Build metrics tracked in `build-metrics.json`
- Core Web Vitals optimization

## Development Best Practices

### Code Style
- Use existing component patterns and design system
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Validate all data against Zod schemas
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Pattern Development
- Always validate new patterns with `npm run test:patterns`
- Use the AI pattern generator for consistent structure
- Include interactive demos when possible
- Ensure accessibility compliance (alt text, semantic HTML)

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new components
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Mock external dependencies (Next.js components, APIs)
- Maintain coverage thresholds

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images before adding to `public/images/`
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Monitor bundle size impact of new dependencies

## AI-Powered Development

This project includes several AI agents for automated development tasks:

### Pattern Generator Agent
- Generates consistent pattern structures
- Creates examples and code samples
- Validates against schemas automatically

### Component Testing Agent
- Generates comprehensive test suites
- Follows testing best practices
- Creates snapshots and interaction tests

### Design Consistency Agent
- Analyzes design system usage
- Generates style guides
- Fixes inconsistencies automatically

### Project Progress Agent (NEW)
- **Monitors all other AI agents** and tracks their outputs
- **Automatically updates task status** when agents complete work
- **Provides intelligent progress reporting** with agent coordination
- **Suggests next priority actions** based on current project state
- **Maintains project status files** (docs/status.md, tasks/tasks.json)
- **Cross-agent communication** - ensures agents work together effectively

#### Agent Integration Features
- **Pattern tracking**: Detects when new patterns are generated (all 14/14 patterns complete)
- **Test monitoring**: Tracks test generation and coverage improvements
- **Design analysis**: Integrates design consistency reports and fixes
- **Build health**: Monitors TypeScript errors and build metrics
- **Smart recommendations**: Suggests optimal sequence of agent execution

These tools are accessible via npm scripts and help maintain code quality and consistency at scale. The Progress Agent acts as a coordination layer that ensures all agents work together effectively and maintains accurate project status.
