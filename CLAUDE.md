## My Development Workflow

### ⚡ Automated Workflow System (NEW - Nov 3, 2025)
**Claude is now configured with automated pattern and guide generation.**

Instead of manually managing tasks, Claude will:
1. **Detect intent** - When you mention "pattern", "guide", "generate", etc.
2. **Auto-suggest** - Proactively recommend the right generator
3. **Explain what happens** - Show what the command will do
4. **Coordinate agents** - Work with test-gen, design agents, etc.

**See [.claude/AUTOMATION-SETUP.md](.claude/AUTOMATION-SETUP.md) for full documentation**

**Quick examples of new behavior**:
- You: "Let's work on Ambient Intelligence"
- Claude: "Ready to generate? Run: `npm run generate-pattern ambient-intelligence`"

- You: "Create a guide for GitHub Copilot"
- Claude: "I'll generate a learning path using your existing guides as templates. Run: `npm run generate-guide`"

This automation system includes:
- ✅ Enhanced pattern-dev skill (`.claude/skills/pattern-dev/SKILL.md`)
- ✅ New guide-gen skill (`.claude/skills/guide-gen/SKILL.md`)
- ✅ Guide generator script (`.scripts/ai-guide-generator.js`)
- ✅ Updated agent orchestrator with guide support

### Pattern Update Workflow (Primary)
**I work on ONE pattern at a time until 100% complete.** Do not move to the next pattern until the current one is finished.

**Now with automation**: Instead of manually creating all files, run `npm run generate-pattern [slug]` and then enhance with images and content.

#### Pattern Completion Checklist
When working on a pattern, ensure ALL of these are completed:
- [ ] Review existing pattern content and structure
- [ ] Update/add code examples (working implementations)
- [ ] Add/update images and visual examples
- [ ] Write/improve text content (description, use cases)
- [ ] Write/update guidelines and considerations
- [ ] Create/update Figma design prompts
- [ ] Build/update interactive demo component
- [ ] Add/update component tests for demo
- [ ] Validate pattern with `npm run test:patterns`
- [ ] Review pattern in browser (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Ensure all assets are optimized

#### Pattern Development Process
1. **Select Pattern**: Choose one pattern from the 12 requiring updates
2. **Review Current State**: Check what exists and what's missing
3. **Work Through Checklist**: Complete items one by one
4. **Validate**: Run tests and review in browser
5. **Mark Complete**: Only when ALL checklist items are done
6. **Move to Next**: Select the next pattern to update

**⚠️ Important Rule**: Stay focused on ONE pattern. Don't jump to another pattern until current one is 100% complete with all checklist items done.

### Session 2026-02-06 12:57 (MacBook)
## Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Modern routing with app directory structure
- **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Pattern-Centric Data Architecture
- Central pattern registry (`src/data/patterns.ts`) imports from individual pattern modules
- Each pattern follows structured format with content, examples, and code samples
- Zod schema validation ensures data integrity (`src/schemas/pattern.schema.ts`)
- Pattern loading utilities handle dynamic imports and validation

#### 2. Context-Based State Management
- `PatternProvider` (`src/contexts/PatternContext.tsx`) provides global pattern state
- Custom hooks (`usePatterns`, `usePattern`, `usePatternsByCategory`) for data access
- Optimized with memoization for performance
- Error boundaries and loading states handled centrally

#### 5. Usage Tracking & Cost Analysis
- **ccusage** integration for Claude Code token usage analysis
- Commands available for monitoring Claude Code costs and usage patterns:
  - `npm run usage` - General usage analysis
  - `npm run usage:daily` - Daily usage breakdown with costs
  - `npm run usage:weekly` - Weekly usage summary  
  - `npm run usage:monthly` - Monthly usage and cost analysis
  - `npm run usage:session` - Session-based usage tracking
  - `npm run usage:blocks` - Block-level usage analysis
  - `npm run usage:json` - JSON output for integration/scripting
- Automatically analyzes existing Claude Code JSONL logs from `~/.claude/projects/`
- Provides detailed cost breakdowns by model (Sonnet-4, Opus-4, etc.)
- Tracks input/output tokens, cache creation/reading, and total costs in USD

#### 3. Component Architecture
- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable design system components
- **Section Components** (`src/components/sections/`): Page-specific sections
- **Example Components** (`src/components/examples/`): Interactive pattern demos
- **Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`): Navigation and structure

#### 4. Type-Safe Schema System
- Zod schemas define all data structures with validation
- TypeScript types exported from schemas for consistency
- Safe and throwing validation functions available
- Development helpers for detailed error reporting

#### 6. Newsletter Subscription System
- **Prisma ORM** with SQLite database for subscriber management (source of truth)
- **Resend** for all email sending (transactional + newsletter delivery via batch API)
- **Beehiiv** subscriber sync on signup (dual-write, fire-and-forget) for future migration when needed
- **Dual-write** on subscribe: saves to Prisma DB + syncs to Beehiiv via API
- **API Routes** for subscribe, unsubscribe, publish (with send-to-subscribers option)
- **Soft Delete** active/inactive subscriber management
- **Unsubscribe Tokens** for one-click unsubscribe functionality
- **See** [Newsletter Documentation](docs/NEWSLETTER.md) for complete guide

### Directory Structure

#### Source Code (`src/`)
- `app/` - Next.js 15 app router pages and layouts

- `schemas/` - Zod validation schemas
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `generated/` - Auto-generated code (Prisma client)

#### Pattern Data (`src/data/patterns/`)
- `patterns/` - Individual pattern implementations
- `categories/` - Pattern category definitions
- `examples/` - Example implementations
- `utils/` - Pattern-specific utilities

#### Testing (`src/components/**/__tests__/`)
- Component tests co-located with components
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- 100% coverage for critical components (Button, CodeBlock)

## Pattern Development Workflow

### Pattern Structure (36/36 Complete ✅)
Pattern implementation follows this structured format:
1. Each pattern has its own directory in `src/data/patterns/patterns/[pattern-name]/`
2. Consistent structure with index.ts, code-examples.ts, considerations.ts, guidelines.ts, examples.ts, figma-prompt.ts
3. All patterns imported in `src/data/patterns.ts`
4. Patterns validated with `npm run test:patterns`
5. Interactive demos for all patterns with working code previews
6. **Current Status**: All 36 patterns fully completed with comprehensive implementations

### Pattern Structure Requirements
- `id` and `slug` must match and use kebab-case
- Minimum 1 example with image, description, and alt text
- Minimum 1 guideline and 1 consideration
- Code examples should include title, description, and working code
- All images must be optimized and use proper formats

## Testing Strategy

- Use absolute paths when necessary rather than changing directories
- Maintain context of the current working directory throughout the session

### Code Style
- Use existing component patterns and design system
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Validate all data against Zod schemas
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Pattern Development
- Always validate new patterns with `npm run test:patterns`
- Use the AI pattern generator for consistent structure
- Include interactive demos when possible
- Ensure accessibility compliance (alt text, semantic HTML)

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new components
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Mock external dependencies (Next.js components, APIs)
- Maintain coverage thresholds

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images before adding to `public/images/`
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Monitor bundle size impact of new dependencies

## Known Issues & Learnings

This section documents issues we've encountered and their solutions, so Claude remembers them in future sessions.

### Cron Jobs & Scheduled Tasks

| Issue | Date | Solution |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Vercel Hobby cron doesn't execute** | Jan 2026 | Vercel free/hobby tier cron jobs are configured in `vercel.json` but don't reliably trigger. Use **cron-job.org** (free) as external trigger instead. |

**cron-job.org Setup:**
- Daily newsletter: `0 3 * * *` (3 AM UTC / 8:30 AM IST) → `https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/api/cron/generate-newsletter`
- Weekly newsletter: `0 2 * * 1` (2 AM UTC / 7:30 AM IST Mon) → `https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/api/cron/generate-newsletter?type=weekly`
- Requires `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header

**Newsletter Troubleshooting Checklist:**

When newsletter doesn't run or emails don't send:

1. **Check cron-job.org has correct CRON_SECRET**
   - Must use the PRODUCTION value from Vercel environment variables
   - NOT the local `.env.local` value (they're different!)

2. **Check cron schedule is correct**
   - Daily: `0 3 * * *` (3 AM UTC = 8:30 AM IST)
   - Weekly: `0 2 * * 1` (2 AM UTC Monday = 7:30 AM IST)

3. **Check database for recent newsletters**
   ```bash
   # Query last 5 newsletters
   DATABASE_URL="..." node -e '
   const { PrismaClient } = require("./src/generated/prisma");
   const prisma = new PrismaClient();
   prisma.newsletterDraft.findMany({ orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }, take: 5 })
     .then(n => n.forEach(x => console.log(x.createdAt, x.type, x.status, x.title.slice(0,40))))
     .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect());
   '
   ```

4. **Manual trigger (use production CRON_SECRET)**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
     "https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/api/cron/generate-newsletter"
   ```

5. **Check Resend dashboard** for transactional email logs: https://resend.com/emails

6. **Check Beehiiv dashboard** for newsletter delivery: https://app.beehiiv.com

7. **Common issues:**
   - 401 Unauthorized → Wrong CRON_SECRET in cron-job.org
   - No newsletter created → Check if "quiet day" (no news) or duplicate prevention blocked it
   - Transactional emails not sent → Check RESEND_API_KEY is valid
   - Subscriber not synced to Beehiiv → Check BEEHIIV_API_KEY and BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID
