## My Development Workflow

### Pattern Update Workflow (Primary)
**I work on ONE pattern at a time until 100% complete.** Do not move to the next pattern until the current one is finished.

#### Pattern Completion Checklist
When working on a pattern, ensure ALL of these are completed:
- [ ] Review existing pattern content and structure
- [ ] Update/add code examples (working implementations)
- [ ] Add/update images and visual examples
- [ ] Write/improve text content (description, use cases)
- [ ] Write/update guidelines and considerations
- [ ] Create/update Figma design prompts
- [ ] Build/update interactive demo component
- [ ] Add/update component tests for demo
- [ ] Validate pattern with `npm run test:patterns`
- [ ] Review pattern in browser (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Ensure all assets are optimized

#### Pattern Development Process
1. **Select Pattern**: Choose one pattern from the 12 requiring updates
2. **Review Current State**: Check what exists and what's missing
3. **Work Through Checklist**: Complete items one by one
4. **Validate**: Run tests and review in browser
5. **Mark Complete**: Only when ALL checklist items are done
6. **Move to Next**: Select the next pattern to update

**⚠️ Important Rule**: Stay focused on ONE pattern. Don't jump to another pattern until current one is 100% complete with all checklist items done.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Modern routing with app directory structure
- **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Pattern-Centric Data Architecture
- Central pattern registry (`src/data/patterns.ts`) imports from individual pattern modules
- Each pattern follows structured format with content, examples, and code samples
- Zod schema validation ensures data integrity (`src/schemas/pattern.schema.ts`)
- Pattern loading utilities handle dynamic imports and validation

#### 2. Context-Based State Management
- `PatternProvider` (`src/contexts/PatternContext.tsx`) provides global pattern state
- Custom hooks (`usePatterns`, `usePattern`, `usePatternsByCategory`) for data access
- Optimized with memoization for performance
- Error boundaries and loading states handled centrally

#### 5. Usage Tracking & Cost Analysis
- **ccusage** integration for Claude Code token usage analysis
- Commands available for monitoring Claude Code costs and usage patterns:
  - `npm run usage` - General usage analysis
  - `npm run usage:daily` - Daily usage breakdown with costs
  - `npm run usage:weekly` - Weekly usage summary  
  - `npm run usage:monthly` - Monthly usage and cost analysis
  - `npm run usage:session` - Session-based usage tracking
  - `npm run usage:blocks` - Block-level usage analysis
  - `npm run usage:json` - JSON output for integration/scripting
- Automatically analyzes existing Claude Code JSONL logs from `~/.claude/projects/`
- Provides detailed cost breakdowns by model (Sonnet-4, Opus-4, etc.)
- Tracks input/output tokens, cache creation/reading, and total costs in USD

#### 3. Component Architecture
- **UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`): Reusable design system components
- **Section Components** (`src/components/sections/`): Page-specific sections
- **Example Components** (`src/components/examples/`): Interactive pattern demos
- **Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`): Navigation and structure

#### 4. Type-Safe Schema System
- Zod schemas define all data structures with validation
- TypeScript types exported from schemas for consistency
- Safe and throwing validation functions available
- Development helpers for detailed error reporting

### Directory Structure

#### Source Code (`src/`)
- `app/` - Next.js 15 app router pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components organized by type
- `contexts/` - React context providers and hooks
- `data/` - Pattern data, categories, and utilities
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (favorites, search, pagination)
- `schemas/` - Zod validation schemas
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

#### Pattern Data (`src/data/patterns/`)
- `patterns/` - Individual pattern implementations
- `categories/` - Pattern category definitions
- `examples/` - Example implementations
- `utils/` - Pattern-specific utilities

#### Testing (`src/components/**/__tests__/`)
- Component tests co-located with components
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- 100% coverage for critical components (Button, CodeBlock)

## Pattern Development Workflow

### Pattern Structure (12/24 Fully Updated)
Pattern implementation follows this structured format:
1. Each pattern has its own directory in `src/data/patterns/patterns/[pattern-name]/`
2. Consistent structure with index.ts, code-examples.ts, considerations.ts, guidelines.ts
3. All patterns imported in `src/data/patterns.ts`
4. Patterns validated with `npm run test:patterns`
5. Interactive demos for completed patterns
6. **Current Status**: 12 patterns fully updated, 12 require comprehensive updates

### Pattern Structure Requirements
- `id` and `slug` must match and use kebab-case
- Minimum 1 example with image, description, and alt text
- Minimum 1 guideline and 1 consideration
- Code examples should include title, description, and working code
- All images must be optimized and use proper formats

## Testing Strategy

- Use absolute paths when necessary rather than changing directories
- Maintain context of the current working directory throughout the session

### Code Style
- Use existing component patterns and design system
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Validate all data against Zod schemas
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Pattern Development
- Always validate new patterns with `npm run test:patterns`
- Use the AI pattern generator for consistent structure
- Include interactive demos when possible
- Ensure accessibility compliance (alt text, semantic HTML)

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new components
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Mock external dependencies (Next.js components, APIs)
- Maintain coverage thresholds

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images before adding to `public/images/`
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Monitor bundle size impact of new dependencies
