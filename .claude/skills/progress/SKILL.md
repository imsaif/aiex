# Progress Dashboard Skill

This skill provides comprehensive visibility into your AI Design Patterns project health, shows what's been accomplished, and suggests intelligent next actions based on current project state.

## When to Use This Skill

Claude will automatically invoke this skill when:
- You ask "what's the project status?"
- You request "show progress"
- You want to know "what's next?"
- You ask "what should I work on?"
- You need a "status report"

### 4. Project Health Indicators

```
🏥 Project Health
├── ✅ Build Status: [Passing/Failing]
├── ✅ Type Safety: [0 TS Errors]
├── ✅ Linting: [0 ESLint Errors]
├── ✅ Tests: [481 tests passing]
├── ✅ Git: [Main branch up to date]
└── ⚠️ Coverage: [48% - Below 70% target]
```

### 5. Agent Activity Status

Shows recent work by AI agents:
- **Pattern Generator**: Last generated pattern, next scheduled
- **Testing Agent**: Coverage improvements, tests added
- **Design Consistency**: Design fixes applied, issues resolved
- **TypeScript Guardian**: Type errors fixed, validation status
- **Progress Agent**: Last report timestamp, agent coordination

### 6. Intelligent Next Priority Actions

Based on current project state, suggests:

#### If Pattern Completion < 50%:
→ **Priority 1: Complete remaining patterns**
- "Work on the next pattern in queue: [Pattern Name]"
- "Use the Pattern Development skill for guided completion"
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours per pattern

#### If Test Coverage < 50%:
→ **Priority 2: Improve test coverage**
- "Generate tests for components with no coverage"
- "Run test generation agent for 10+ untested components"
- Current gap: +22% needed to reach 70% target

#### If Build/Types Have Errors:
→ **Priority 1: Fix build blockers**
- "Run: npm run ts-fix && npm run lint -- --fix"
- "Fix TypeScript errors blocking deployment"

#### If Tests Are Failing:
→ **Priority 0: Fix test failures**
- "Investigate and fix failing tests immediately"
- "Run: npm test to see detailed failure info"

#### If All Clear:
→ **Suggested Workflow**:
1. Complete next pattern from the 12 remaining
2. Generate tests for pattern's demo component
3. Validate with npm run test:patterns
4. Deploy and celebrate! 🎉

## Workflow Integration

### Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Start Session** → Use `/start` command to pull latest changes
2. **Check Progress** → Use this Progress Dashboard skill
3. **Identify Priority** → Follow the suggested next actions
4. **Work** → Use Pattern Development skill for pattern updates
5. **Validate** → Run tests, check build, review in browser
6. **End Session** → Use `/save` command to commit and push

### Agent Coordination

This skill monitors and coordinates:
- **Pattern Generator** → Tracks which patterns are being generated
- **Testing Agent** → Monitors test coverage improvements
- **Design Consistency** → Tracks design fixes applied
- **TypeScript Guardian** → Monitors type safety status
- **Project Progress Agent** → Synchronizes all status updates

✅ **Session 2025-10-16**: Vercel Analytics integrated for page view tracking and web vitals
✅ **Session 2025-10-14**: Enhanced memory management system for agent coordination
🚀 **Major**: Improved test coverage from ~20% to 48% (128% improvement!)
🚀 **Major**: Fixed all major component test failures with proper mocking

## Success Indicators

Project is healthy when:
- ✅ 24/24 patterns complete
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ 0 ESLint errors
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Clean git history
- ✅ Deployed to production

## Next Steps

Based on current 12/24 pattern completion:

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Complete 12 remaining patterns
   - Estimated: 50-60 hours work
   - Use Pattern Development skill for each
   - Priority order: [From 12 requiring updates]

2. **Phase 2** (After Phase 1): Reach 70% test coverage
   - Estimated: 20-30 hours
   - Use Testing Agent to generate tests
   - Focus on uncovered branches

3. **Phase 3** (Final): Production optimization
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - SEO and analytics integration
